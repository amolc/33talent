                                33 Talent and Riley did a great job of connecting me with lots of companies and moving me to the job offer phase fairly quickly. Riley was always very responsive and efficient, a pleasure to work with!

                          <p class="testimonials-para">
                                While 33 Talent represented me, I never felt I was working with a cold job consultant who was only interested in filling the position for an organisation who had hired him. I always saw Ken as being a well-wishing friend and guide. Working with professionals like Ken really makes candidates more confident in attempting career moves such as I did.

                                "From the moment I made contact with Rob, what struck me most was his intelligent, friendly, professional manner and (as time would prove) his adeptness to mediate between the interests of all parties. Rob placed me in two of the most important roles of my career so far... he was spot on in his judgement and this only goes to demonstrate his skill within his chosen sector. A professional to the core and a true pleasure to work with."
